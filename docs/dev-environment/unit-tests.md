## Unit test source code
Unit test source files should follow naming convention:

`<component we want to test>.test.ts`

for example
`Auth0Provider.test.ts`

Test file should be located in the same directory as the code it testsjkkkA

## Running tests

`pnpm test`

## Reconfiguring unit tests
uni tests are setup using vite so for any additional configuration and useful tools/tips refer to their docs
